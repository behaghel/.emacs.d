# Keybinding Semantics: Consistent, Discoverable, Mode-Aware

This document proposes a cohesive keybinding semantic for our Emacs configuration that:

- Drives consistency across packages and languages.
- Centralizes declaration so bindings are easy to find and audit.
- Works with Evil (modal), GUI/TTY, and both global and mode-local contexts.
- Scales to language environments so similar actions share the same keys.
- Is discoverable at runtime via which‑key and hydra palettes.

The design borrows from excellent setups (Doom, Spacemacs, Prot’s dotemacs) while fitting our comma leader and module architecture.

---

## Goals

- Consistency: the same category prefix across modes (files, buffers, windows, project, VCS, search, code, test, debug, repl, docs, toggles, apps).
- Single source of truth: each module declares bindings in one place using a standard API.
- Mode layering: global leader for universal actions; localleader for mode/language‑specific actions.
- Discoverability: which‑key shows categories; hydra palettes offer a visual/interactive cheat sheet.
- Minimal surprises: keep existing mental model where it helps; reduce global pollution.

## High‑Level Semantics

- Leader: `,` in Evil normal state (primary global prefix).
- Localleader: `;` (single‑key, per major‑mode domain). For insert/motion, keep minimal targeted bindings.
- Category prefixes under leader:
  - `,f`: Files (open/save/recent/rename)
  - `,b`: Buffers (switch/kill/rename/reopen)
  - `,w`: Windows (split/move/resize/tabs)
  - `,p`: Project (switch/find/search/shell)
  - `,g`: VCS (Magit, hunk nav, diff)
  - `,s`: Search (ripgrep/consult, in‑buffer, xref)
  - `,e`: Evaluate/Execute (eval/compile/shell)
  - `,c`: Contextual actions for the current buffer domain; code buffers use it for Code (LSP actions, format, refactor), while Org/prose buffers use it for context-panel comments and review state.
  - `,t`: Test/Toggle (tests; UI toggles under `,t u`)
  - `,d`: Debug (dap/gud; language‑specific debug)
  - `,r`: REPL/Run (start/send buffer/region)
  - `,h`: Help/Docs (describe, docsets, symbols)
  - `,o`: Open/Apps (Treemacs, Elfeed, mail, terminals)
  - `,x`: Text/Transform (align/sort/narrow)
  - `,y`: Yank/Copy helpers (paths, URLs)
  - `,q`: Quit/Session (workspace/session management)
  - `,?`: Cheat sheet (hydra/which‑key landing)

Notes:
- Mode‑specific items go under localleader by default (`;` …). If a command is universal (e.g., `consult-line`), place it under leader (`,s`), not localleader.
- Conflicts resolved via per‑mode maps and which‑key labels; avoid grabbing common keys in insert state.

## Language & Programming Semantics

For programming modes, consistency matters most. Reserve these under leader and localleader:

- `,c` Code:
  - `,c a` LSP/Code Action
  - `,c f` Format buffer/region
  - `,c r` Refactor (rename/symbol)
  - `,c i` Inspect/type info
  - `,c g` Goto (def/refs/impl)
- `,t` Test:
  - `,t t` Test current (file/it)
  - `,t a` Test all
  - `,t r` Rerun
  - `,t s` Toggle test/target buffer
- `,r` REPL/Run:
  - `,r r` Start/attach REPL
  - `,r b` Send buffer
  - `,r e` Send region/sexp
  - `,r l` Load file
- `,d` Debug:
  - `,d d` Start debug
  - `,d b` Toggle breakpoint
  - `,d c` Continue/step controls

Localleader (`;` …) mirrors the same namespaces for mode‑specific extras that don’t warrant global exposure (e.g., language tool menus, generators).

## Structural Motions & Text Objects

Structural navigation and editing should be consistent across languages and modes. We unify:

1) Evil text objects and motions
- Retain core motions/objects and add semantic ones (function/class/block/arg/etc.).

2) Tree‑sitter semantics (Emacs 29+)
- Provide motions and objects using Tree‑sitter:
  - Motions: `g n/p` (next/prev node), `g u` parent, `g d` child, `g f/F` next/prev function, `g c/C` class, `g b/B` block.
  - Text objects: `i f`/`a f` (function), `i c`/`a c` (class), `i b`/`a b` (block), `i a`/`a a` (arg/param), `i s`/`a s` (string), `i C`/`a C` (comment), etc.
- Implementation strategy: prefer built‑ins (treesit‑beginning/end‑of‑thing), complement with evil text‑object helpers where needed. For languages lacking treesit, fall back to imenu/regex heuristics.

3) Smartparens pairs
- Slurp/barf/unwrap consistently; available via a structural hydra and localleader `;` → `s` group to avoid clutter.

### Insert-Mode Structural Editing

Goal: structural edits without leaving insert state, across languages.

- C-<right>: slurp forward (move next form inside current parens)
- C-<left>: barf forward (push last element out of current parens)
- M-<left>: slurp backward
- M-<right>: barf backward
- C-M-u: unwrap (remove surrounding pair)
- C-M-s: splice (unwrap + join where appropriate)
- C-M-t: transpose sexps
- C-M-w: wrap round (surround with parens)

Notes:
- Backed by Smartparens when available; falls back gracefully otherwise.
- The structural hydra remains under `,c s` and localleader `; s` for discovery and motions; these insert-mode keys focus on fast edit operations.

Org‑mode mapping
- Apply the same mental model to Org elements: headline/subtree, src block, list item, table. Reuse `g` motions and `i/a` objects accordingly.

Discovery hydra
- `,c s` (and/or localleader `;` → `s`) summons a per‑mode structural hydra showing motions and objects with which‑key labels.

## Visual Discovery

- which‑key: Required. Shows category names and command labels for prefixes. Category prefixes will be labeled (e.g., `,g` → “VCS/Git”, `,c` → “Code”).
- Hydra palettes:
  - `,?` Global cheat sheet hydra showing top‑level categories and most common sub‑bindings.
  - Category hydras (optional) under each prefix, e.g., `,w` pops a window‑management hydra; `,g` offers common Magit actions.
- Optional: embark integration for context‑aware actions.

Must‑have packages
- embark: action layer and minibuffer hints.
- which‑key: prefix discovery.
- general.el: declarative key definitions with leader/localleader definers.

## Policy

- Avoid binding plain letters globally; use leader/localleader in normal state.
- Keep insert‑state bindings minimal and mode‑specific.
- Respect TTY constraints and non‑ASCII ergonomics; provide fallbacks where needed.

Repository layout for keys
- Keep global keymaps in a dedicated file (e.g., `modules/interactive/editing/keys.el`), separate from Evil setup (`editing/evil.el`).
- `hub-keys.el` in `lisp/` provides the leader/localleader definers and shared helpers (DWIM, speed‑dial, hydra entry points).

## DWIM (Do What I Mean) Philosophy

Bindings should adapt to context while keeping the same chord:

- `,f f` find‑file DWIM: if in a project → `project-find-file`, else → `find-file`.
- `,s s` search DWIM: project ripgrep if in project, else `consult-line` (or ripgrep in current dir if large buffer).
- `,b s` switch buffer DWIM: prefer `consult-project-buffer` in project, else `consult-buffer`.
- `,c f` format DWIM: prefer Eglot formatter if managed, else fallback (apheleia/indent-region).
- `,t t` test DWIM: run nearest/file based on mode; rerun if already failed.
- `,r r` REPL DWIM: attach to existing REPL if present, else start appropriate one.
- `,g /` VCS grep DWIM: use `consult-git-grep` if in Git repo, else `consult-ripgrep`.

Implementation approach
- Provide a small library of `hub/dwim-*` helpers and use them throughout `:general` bindings.
- Make DWIM functions first‑class in the migration: replacing direct command bindings with DWIM wrappers.

Open brainstorm for further DWIM dimensions
- OS/open‑with (browse URL vs eww); window reuse vs pop; symbol at point defaulting; region vs buffer target.

## Naming & Labels

- which‑key names every prefix with a readable title:
  - `,f` “Files”, `,b` “Buffers”, `,w` “Windows”, `,p` “Project”, `,g` “VCS/Git”, `,s` “Search”,
    `,e` “Eval/Exec”, `,c` “Code”, `,t` “Test/Toggle”, `,d` “Debug”, `,r` “REPL/Run”,
    `,h` “Help/Docs”, `,o` “Open/Apps”, `,x` “Text/Transform”, `,y` “Yank/Copy”, `,q` “Quit/Session”.
- Use consistent sub‑keys across languages; e.g., `,t t` is always “test current”, `,c a` is always “code action” in code buffers.

Org/prose context-panel semantics
- In Org buffers, `,c` is the Context prefix rather than Code:
  - `,c c` create a sidecar comment for the visual selection.
  - `,c m` open the context panel.
  - `,c M` toggle automatic context-panel follow/refresh mode.
  - `,c O` mark the active comment OPEN.
  - `,c T` mark the active comment TODO, meaning action is required from me.
  - `,c R` mark the active comment RESOLVED.
  - `,c s` cycle the active comment status.

## Conflict & Mode Policy

- Mode maps can shadow global leader keys for better UX, but must retain category semantics.
- `,c` is intentionally domain-contextual: in programming buffers it means Code; in Org/prose buffers it means Context, especially context-panel comments and review state. Do not bind code actions under `,c` in non-code buffers.
- Packages integrate via mode‑local bindings under localleader unless they fit a global category.
- Never redefine a category prefix to mean a completely unrelated domain within a mode.

## Migration Plan

1. Core helpers: add leader/localleader definers and which‑key labels.
2. Global keys: move truly global bindings into a central module using `hub/leader`.
3. Package pass 1: convert scattered `define-key` to declarative bindings, aligning to categories.
4. Language pass: ensure `,c`, `,t`, `,r`, `,d` actions are present and consistent for JS/TS, Python, Ruby, Scala, etc.
5. Discovery: add `,?` global hydra; optional hydras for `,w`, `,g`, `,p`.
6. Docs: keep this spec as the source of truth; update when categories evolve.

## Backwards Compatibility

- Keep legacy aliases for most‑used chords for one cycle with deprecation notices in which‑key labels.
- Respect TTY constraints: avoid sequences that render poorly; provide fallbacks.

## BÉPO Keyboard Adaptations

These additions tailor the above semantics to the BÉPO layout while preserving categories and discoverability.

### Home‑Row Navigation

- c / t / s / r map to left / up / down / right in motion/normal states.
- Implemented via Evil/Evil‑Collection translation (see `modules/interactive/editing/evil.el`). Most modes inherit this automatically (including Magit, Org, mu4e, Treemacs), while some modes also need explicit mode-local rebinding to preserve their intended semantics after package setup.
- **Policy**: Normal state is the canonical base state for all Evil‑integrated modes. The bépo ctsr rotation depends on normal/motion state keymaps and will not function in emacs state. Any mode forced into emacs state must be justified in `editing/evil.el`.

### Operators & Motions

- Change operator: prefer `l` instead of Vim’s `c` (not yet global; planned opt‑in layer).
- Until motion: prefer `h` instead of Vim’s `t` (not yet global; planned opt‑in layer).

### Selection Semantics

- `à` = select/apply (contextual):
  - Org: refile; Mail: archive/refile/mark; Magit: stage.
- `À` = reverse/inverse where that semantic exists.
  - Magit: unstage.
  - mu4e: archive in headers mode today; there is no current inverse/unselect semantic.
  - Org: no explicit inverse operation today.

### Prefixes

- `z` or `,z`: toggles/flags (threading, include‑related, visibility, UI toggles).
- `m` or `,m`: marks (pattern marks, bulk marks) when the mode supports it.

### Current Usage Snapshot

This section is descriptive, not normative. For the current implementation, see
`modules/interactive/editing/evil.el` and `modules/interactive/email/view.el`.

- mu4e
- Headers: `T` next primary; `S` previous primary; `C-t`/`C-s` raw next/prev message; `J` jump to maildir (Evil normal); `g t`/`g s` next/prev unread; `à` refile; `À` archive; `!` spam; `%` mark-by-pattern; `zê` full-search; `zé` threading; `zÉ` include-related; `z!` read thread; `zD` delete thread; `zà` refile thread; `zS` block sender → spam.
- View: `T` next primary; `S` previous primary; `C-t`/`C-s` raw next/prev message; `J` jump to maildir (Evil normal); `g t`/`g s` next/prev unread; `!` spam-and-advance; `zS` move to spam.
- Org
  - `à` refile; `,à` archive subtree. Movement via c/t/s/r.
- Magit
  - `à` stage; `À` unstage. Movement via c/t/s/r; `s` repurposed as previous line in status/hunk maps.

### Inconsistencies Observed (not changed yet)

- Evil change still on `c`; until still on `t/T`.
- mu4e uses `À` for archive (action) rather than “reverse/unselect”.
- Org has no explicit `À` inverse operation.

### Recommendations

- Provide an opt‑in global remap layer for `l`→change and `h`→until.
- If `À` is meant to stay semantically “reverse”, either leave it unbound in mu4e or define a real inverse operation; until then, treat mu4e archive on `À` as a documented exception.
- Keep `z` for toggles and `m` for marks across modes.
