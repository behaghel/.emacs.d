# Knowledge and Writing

## Ubiquitous Language

- **Semantic layer**: Author-facing Org contract describing meaning independently from output styling.
- **Class family**: A related set of LaTeX/PDF export classes and variants.
- **Specimen**: Tracked Org input used to verify export behavior.
- **Authoring shortcut**: Interactive helper that inserts or transforms writing markup.
- **Publishing workflow**: Export or synchronization path from Org content to an external medium.

## Invariants

- Author-facing semantics must stay separate from class-specific visual styling.
- Export behavior should be testable from tracked specimens and textual assertions before relying on visual inspection.
- Writing helpers should not make batch loads depend on interactive-only packages unless guarded.
- Machine-specific paths belong in private overrides or defcustoms, not hard-coded shared behavior.
- Generated PDFs, TeX files, screenshots, and visual diff artifacts belong under runtime output locations, not tracked golden files.

## Integration Notes

This domain consumes shared prose/key helpers and conforms to the interactive command surface.  Export-specific specs may live beside the export code or in the existing spec tree when they describe broader authoring contracts.
